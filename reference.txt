Added Bootstrap:

->added navbar
->added search bar
->added task card
->added necessary outline buttons
->added card image

->added modal
->added form inputs to modal

-->create a function to save changes
->inside it create an object to store task card data
->use the getElementById method to get the html tags id 

->In html, add a tag to the div tag which stores all the cards & store that class name in a variable
->use queryselector instead of getElementByClass to avoid getting the html element in the form of an array
->queryselector gets all the html code inside the html element which was accessed
->create a function to create a new card using template literal and destructure the task data object as a parameter
->assign the id's inside the template literal

->create a constant and call the create new card function inside it passing the task data
