# Taskify-Memo-Web-App
Manage you memos with Taskify. I have created this web application using bootstrap for the frontend and vanilla javascript for the backend. I have implemented concepts like DOM manipulation and local-storage api (provided by browser) to add CRUD-like (create-read-up-delete) functionality to this web app.
